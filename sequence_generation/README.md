## sequence_generation

### generate_genomes.py

Generate synthetic genomes from PanBART models. Integrates synteny predictions with gene-level sequence generation to create complete genome assemblies with configurable genome sizes and sampling parameters.

### synteny_accuracy.py

Evaluate synteny accuracy of generated genomes using network analysis. Compares gene neighborhood relationships between generated and reference genomes using graph-based metrics to assess preservation of genomic context and gene order.
